  - 'Behind the old tree stump you find a broken stone tablet.

    The tablet is
    in a poor shape and barely readable.'
  - "You can make out the following text\n\"Final rest... place for Count Me..so..\"
    \nThe rest of the tablet is indistinguishable"
  - You turn the tablet over, it looks like someone have chiseled something on the
    back.
  - 'It reads: "Found this tablet out in the desert past the lone pillar to the north,
    no clue how it ended up here. This place is nothing but sand and rocks"'
